### Built With

<!-- TODO: List any MAJOR libraries/frameworks (e.g. React, Tailwind) with links to their homepages. -->

-This application was developed with Angular 13 for the frontend, and connects through an Api made with  the Express framework from NODEJS

## Features

<!-- TODO: List what specific 'user problems' that this application solves. -->
-The problem that I was designated to solve, was the lack of a system to manage the personal record of each member of the company, but instead of having a unique archive they asked for a separate record for each area of the company
e.g Luis Miguel could have a record in HR department and at the same time a different record in quality control department, each record only accesible for a authorized users

the structure of the system is quite simple but efficient, made with lists interface you can access to all the tools within seconds, improvements can be done, but for the client needs it was all they needed
